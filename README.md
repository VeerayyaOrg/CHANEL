# CHANEL
The Chanel boutique
If you want to follow in the designer’s footsteps, head next to Chanel’s flagship retail store on 31 Rue Cambon. Next year, the address will celebrate 100 years of Chanel history, given the fact that Chanel installed her couture house in the building in 1918. Today, the couture offices are still in the very same place.
